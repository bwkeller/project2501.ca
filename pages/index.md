<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>I am a human male, 20-something years old, from Canada.  I was born
in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calgary">Calgary</a>, but I currently reside in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton,_Ontario">Hamilton</a>.  </p>

<h3>Academics</h3>
<p>I'm currently a PhD student at McMaster University. I got my BSc in Physics
with a minor in Computer Science from the University of Calgary in 2011. My
current research involves numerical modelling of galaxy evolution over
cosmological timescales.</p> <p>As an undergraduate at the U of C, I worked with
<a href="http://www.ras.ucalgary.ca/~stil/">Dr. Jeroen Stil</a> on stacking
radio polarization to examine faint extragalactic sources. Our work should
produce a few papers in
2012. I also generated a large sky simulation that was used in 
<a href="http://www.physics.mcmaster.ca/~kellerbw/publications.html">George
et al.  2011</a>, and worked in the POSSUM Working Group 2 to determine
the requirements for stacking applications for the Australian SKA
Pathfinder (ASKAP) radio telescope.</p> <p>At McMaster, I work with <a
href="http://imp.mcmaster.ca/">Dr. James Wadsley</a> in the Physics &amp;
Astronomy department. My current research is focused on developing and
improving subgrid models used in Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH)
models of galaxies. I'm particularly interested in learning how to
accurately model stellar feedback at different resolutions. Once this work
is done, I hope to be able to use it to produce really good galactic
initial conditions for simulating mergers and AGNs.</p> <p>I'm a TA for
PHYS 1BB3 (Modern Physics for Life Sciences) PHYS 3B(A/B)3 (Electronics),
PHYS 2G03 (Scientific Computing) and ASTRON 1B03 (Big Questions).  If you
are one of my students, feel free to email me if you'd like to ask me any
questions, or set up office hours.  </p>
