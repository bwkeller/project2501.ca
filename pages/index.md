## About Me 
I am a human male, 20-something years old, from Canada.  I was born
in [Calgary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calgary), but I currently reside in
[Hamilton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton,_Ontario).  
### Academics 
I'm currently a PhD student at McMaster University. I got my BSc in Physics with a
minor in Computer Science from the University of Calgary in 2011. My current
research involves numerical modelling of galaxy evolution over cosmological
timescales.

As an undergraduate at the U of C, I worked with [Dr. Jeroen
Stil](http://www.ras.ucalgary.ca/~stil/) on stacking radio polarization to
examine faint extragalactic sources. Our work should produce a few papers in
2012. I also generated a large sky simulation that was used in [George et al.
2011](http://www.physics.mcmaster.ca/~kellerbw/publications.html), and worked in
the POSSUM Working Group 2 to determine the requirements for stacking
applications for the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) radio telescope.

At McMaster, I work with [Dr. James Wadsley](http://imp.mcmaster.ca/) in the
Physics & Astronomy department. My current research is focused on developing and
improving subgrid models used in Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) models of
galaxies. I'm particularly interested in learning how to accurately model
stellar feedback at different resolutions. Once this work is done,
I hope to be able to use it to produce really good galactic initial conditions
for simulating mergers and AGNs.

I'm a TA for PHYS 1BB3 (Modern Physics for Life Sciences) PHYS 3B(A/B)3
(Electronics), and ASTRON 1B03 (Big Questions). If you are one of my students,
feel free to email me if you'd like to ask me any questions, or set up office
hours.
