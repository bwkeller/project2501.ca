## Software
### [PyAQUOS](http://github.com/bwkeller/pyaquos)
So, when I bought my TV, the first thing I did when unpacking it was to take
a look at all the pretty ports on the back.  I was delighted to see a RS-232
serial port!  I pulled out the manual, found a command directory in the back,
and set to work writing up a python module for interfacing with it.

Check out my [github](http://github.com/bwkeller) to see some of the bits I have flipped.

Bigger stuff may get a mention here.  Keep an eye on this spot.
